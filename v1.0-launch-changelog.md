# Announcing Version 1.0: The Ultimate Whitelabel Solution for Consultancies

We are thrilled to announce the release of **Version 1.0**, a major milestone that transforms our platform into a fully whitelabel-ready solution for educational consultancies. This release focuses on empowering agencies to provide a branded, premium experience to their students while leveraging our powerful AI technology.

## 🚀 New Features

### 🎨 Whitelabeling & Custom Branding
The core of this release is the ability for consultancies to make the platform their own.
- **Custom Subdomains**: Agencies can now have their own dedicated web address (e.g., `global-edu.consularly.com`), providing a professional entry point for their students.
- **Dynamic Logo & Favicon**: Upload your agency's logo and favicon. The system dynamically updates the browser tab icon and application header to match your brand identity.
- **Brand Colors & Theming**: We've implemented a dynamic styling engine that injects your primary and secondary brand colors across the entire application—from buttons and borders to progress bars and accents.
- **Custom CSS Support**: For agencies needing pixel-perfect control, we now support safe injection of custom CSS to fine-tune the look and feel.
- **Branded Emails**: Automated notifications and updates now carry your agency's branding, ensuring a consistent communication experience.

### 🏢 B2B & Agency Tools
We've refined the experience specifically for B2B partners.
- **New B2B Hero Section**: A redesigned landing page section specifically targeting consultancies, highlighting student tracking and AI capabilities.
- **Student Tracking Dashboard**: A comprehensive view to monitor every student's journey from enrollment to visa approval.
- **AI-Powered Mock Interviews**: Agencies can now offer their students unlimited AI mock interviews with personalized feedback, tailored to specific universities and countries.
- **Whitelabel Feature Showcase**: A new dedicated section on the homepage explaining the value of our whitelabel solution to prospective agency partners.

### 🔒 Security & Infrastructure
- **Enhanced Subdomain Authentication**: We've completely overhauled the authentication flow to ensure strict data isolation. Users can only log in to the subdomain they belong to.
- **Organization-Level Data Isolation**: Implemented robust middleware and guard components to prevent cross-organization data access, ensuring student data remains private and secure within each agency's tenant.
- **Optimized Asset Loading**: Improved loading performance for branded assets (fonts, logos) to ensure a smooth "flash-free" experience.
